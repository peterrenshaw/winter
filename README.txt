 "See the above image? I want to re-create it in code."


* About

- Processing and ProcessingJS code to generate data to create images.
- Working with images and objects using processing2 to represent as leaves.
  This particular bit of code extracts co-ordinates of selected objects and
  extracts vertex information to build the outline shape. The code will 
  eventually export the data as JSON.
- exported data is then used to generate images in processingjs.
